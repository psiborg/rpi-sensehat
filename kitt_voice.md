# KITT's Voice Box

Here's the calculations used to simulate KITT's voice box:

```py
for col in [3, 4]:
    for row in range(3 - height//2, 4 + height//2):
        pixels[row*8 + col] = red_high if row in [3, 4] else red_medium

for col in [1, 2, 5, 6]:
    for row in range(4 - height//2, 3 + height//2):
        pixels[row*8 + col] = red_low
```

## Explanation:

1. Column Selection:

    - The first loop iterates over columns [3, 4].
    - The second loop iterates over columns [1, 2, 5, 6].

    These loops determine which columns of the LED matrix will be affected.

2. Row Calculation:

    - Middle Columns (3, 4):

        ```py
        for row in range(3 - height//2, 4 + height//2):
        ```

        - 3 - height//2: This calculation determines the starting row.
        - 4 + height//2: This calculation determines the ending row (exclusive).
        - height//2 divides the height by 2 using integer division, ensuring the bars are centered vertically.
        - Example: If height is 4, height//2 is 2. The range becomes range(1, 6), covering rows 1 to 5.

    - Outer Columns (1, 2, 5, 6):

        ```py
        for row in range(4 - height//2, 3 + height//2):
        ```

        - 4 - height//2: This calculation is similar but shifted by 1 row to align with the reduced height.
        - 3 + height//2: This calculation mirrors the middle column calculation for consistency.
        - Example: If height is 4, height//2 is 2. The range becomes range(2, 5), covering rows 2 to 4.

3. Pixel Position Calculation:

    - row*8 + col: This formula calculates the position of a specific LED in the pixels list.
    - The Sense HAT's 8x8 matrix is represented as a list of 64 elements (8 rows Ã— 8 columns).
    - row*8 gives the starting index of the row, and adding col gives the column offset within that row.
    - Example: For row = 3 and col = 4, the index is 3*8 + 4 = 28.

4. LED Color Assignment:

    - Middle Columns (3, 4):

        ```py
        pixels[row*8 + col] = red_high if row in [3, 4] else red_medium
        ```

        - This line assigns red_high to the middle rows (3 and 4) and red_medium to the other rows within the range.

    - Outer Columns (1, 2, 5, 6):

        ```py
        pixels[row*8 + col] = red_low
        ```

        - This line assigns red_low to the rows in these columns, reflecting the dimmer outer bars.

## Summary:

- The code block calculates the pixel positions for the expanding bars in the middle and outer columns, based on the specified height.
- The pixel colors are assigned according to the row position, with the middle rows being the brightest (red_high), and the surrounding rows gradually dimming (red_medium, red_low). This approach ensures that the bars appear to expand from the middle and fade outwards.
